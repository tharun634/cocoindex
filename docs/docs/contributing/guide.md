[CocoIndex](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex) is an open source project. We are respectful, open and friendly. This guide explains how to get involved and contribute to [CocoIndex](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex).

Our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/zpA9S2DR7s) is constantly open.
If you are unsure about anything, it is a good place to discuss! We'd love to collaborate and will always be friendly.

## Good First Issues

We tag issues with the ["good first issue"](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label for beginner contributors.

## How to Contribute
- If you decide to take an issue, we recommend you to leave a comment on the issue like  **`Can I work on this issue?`** so we could assign it to you. This helps you and others avoid duplicating work.
- For larger features, we recommend you to discuss with us first in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/zpA9S2DR7s) to coordinate the design and work.
