# CocoIndex CLI

CocoIndex CLI is a standalone tool for easily managing and inspecting your flows and indexes.

## Invoke the CLI

Once CocoIndex is installed, you can invoke the CLI directly using the `cocoindex` command. Most commands require an `APP_TARGET` argument, which tells the CLI where your flow definitions are located.

### APP_TARGET Format

The `APP_TARGET` can be:
1.  An **Python module name** that contains your flow definitions (e.g., `main`, `my_package.flows`).
    You can also use `--app-dir <path>` to specify the base directory to load the module from.

2.  A **path to a Python file** defining your flows (e.g., `main.py`, `path/to/my_flows.py`).

    The file will be loaded as a top-level Python module, e.g. relative imports will not work as its parent package is not defined (similar to how `python main.py` resolves imports).

3.  For commands that operate on a *specific flow* (like `show`, `update`, `evaluate`), you can combine the application reference with a flow name:
    * `my_package.flows:MyFlow`
    * `path/to/my_flows.py:MyFlow`

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are needed as CocoIndex library settings, as described in [CocoIndex Settings](settings#list-of-environment-variables).

You can set environment variables in an environment file.

*   By default, the `cocoindex` CLI searches upward from the current directory for a `.env` file.
*   You can use `--env-file <path>` to specify one explicitly:

    ```sh
    cocoindex --env-file path/to/custom.env <COMMAND> ...
    ```

Loaded variables do *NOT* override existing system ones.
If no file is found, only existing system environment variables are used.

### Global Options

CocoIndex CLI supports the following global options:

* `--env-file <path>`: Load environment variables from a specified `.env` file. If not provided, `.env` in the current directory is loaded if it exists.
* `--app-dir <path>`: Load apps from the specified directory. It will be treated as part of `PYTHONPATH`. Default to the current directory.
* `--version`: Show the CocoIndex version and exit.
* `--help`: Show the main help message and exit.
