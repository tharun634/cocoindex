# CocoIndex Setting

Certain settings need to be provided for CocoIndex to work, e.g. database connections, app namespace, etc.

## Configure CocoIndex Settings

Note that in general, you have two ways to launch CocoIndex:

*   Call CocoIndex APIs from your own Python application or library.
*   Use [Cocoindex CLI](cli). It's handy for most routine indexing building and management tasks.


CocoIndex exposes process-level settings specified by `cocoindex.Settings` dataclass.
Settings can be configured in three different ways.
In the following sections, the later ones will override the earlier ones.

### Environment Variables

The simplest approach is to set corresponding environment variables.
See [List of Environment Variables](#list-of-environment-variables) for specific environment variables.

:::tip

You can consider place a `.env` file in your directory.
The [CLI](cli#environment-variables) will load environment variables from the `.env` file (see [CLI](cli#environment-variables) for more details).
From your own main module, you can also load environment variables with a package like [`python-dotenv`](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv).

:::

### Setting Function

A more flexible approach is to provide a setting function that returns a `cocoindex.Settings` dataclass object.
The setting function can have any name, and needs to be decorated with the `@cocoindex.settings` decorator, for example:

```py
@cocoindex.settings
def cocoindex_settings() -> cocoindex.Settings:
    return cocoindex.Settings(
        database=cocoindex.DatabaseConnectionSpec(
            url="postgres://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost/cocoindex"
        )
    )
```

This setting function will be called once when CocoIndex is initialized.
Once the settings function is provided, environment variables will be ignored.

### `cocoindex.init()` function

You can also call `cocoindex.init()` with a `cocoindex.Settings` dataclass object as argument, for example:

```py
cocoindex.init(
    cocoindex.Settings(
        database=cocoindex.DatabaseConnectionSpec(
            url="postgres://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost/cocoindex"
        )
    )
)
```

For example, you can call it in the main function of your application.
Once the `cocoindex.init()` is called with a `cocoindex.Settings` dataclass object as argument, the `@cocoindex.settings` function and environment variables will be ignored.

This is more flexible, as you can more easily construct `cocoindex.Settings` based on other stuffs you loaded earlier.
But be careful that if you call `cocoindex.init()` only under the path of main (e.g. within `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard), it won't be executed when you're using CocoIndex CLI, as it won't execute your main logic.

:::info

`cocoindex.init()` is optional:

-   You can call `cocoindex.init()` with a `cocoindex.Settings` dataclass object as argument, or without any argument.
    When without argument, the settings will be loaded from the `@cocoindex.settings` function or environment variables.

-   You don't have to explicitly call `cocoindex.init()`.
    CocoIndex will be automatically initialized when needed, e.g. when any method of any flow is called the first time.
    But calling `cocoindex.init()` explicitly (usually at startup time, e.g. in the main function of your application) has the benefit of making sure CocoIndex library is initialized and any potential exceptions are raised earlier before proceeding with the application.
    If you need this clarity, you can call it explicitly even if you don't want to provide settings by the `cocoindex.init()` call.

## List of Settings

`cocoindex.Settings` is a dataclass that contains the following fields:

*   `app_namespace` (type: `str`, required): The namespace of the application.
*   `database` (type: `DatabaseConnectionSpec`, required): The connection to the Postgres database.
*   `global_execution_options` (type: `GlobalExecutionOptions`, optional): The global execution options shared by all  flows.

### App Namespace

The `app_namespace` field helps organize flows across different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production), team members, etc. When set, it prefixes flow names with the namespace.

For example, if the namespace is `Staging`, for a flow with name specified as `Flow1` in code, the full name of the flow will be `Staging.Flow1`.
You can also get the current app namespace by calling `cocoindex.get_app_namespace()` (see [Getting App Namespace](flow_def#getting-app-namespace) for more details).

If not set, all flows are in a default unnamed namespace.

*Environment variable*: `COCOINDEX_APP_NAMESPACE`

### DatabaseConnectionSpec

`DatabaseConnectionSpec` configures the connection to a database. Only Postgres is supported for now. It has the following fields:

*   `url` (type: `str`): The URL of the Postgres database to use as the internal storage, e.g. `postgres://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost/cocoindex`.

    *Environment variable* for `Settings.database.url`: `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_URL`

*   `user` (type: `Optional[str]`, default: `None`): The username for the Postgres database. If not provided, username will come from `url`.

    *Environment variable* for `Settings.database.user`: `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_USER`

*   `password` (type: `Optional[str]`, default: `None`): The password for the Postgres database. If not provided, password will come from `url`.

    *Environment variable* for `Settings.database.password`: `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_PASSWORD`

    :::tip

    Please be careful that all values in `url` needs to be url-encoded if they contain special characters.
    For this reason, prefer to use the separated `user` and `password` fields for username and password.

    :::

*   `max_connections` (type: `int`, default: `25`): The maximum number of connections to keep in the pool.

    *Environment variable* for `Settings.database.max_connections`: `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS`

*   `min_connections` (type: `int`, default: `5`): The minimum number of connections to keep in the pool.

    *Environment variable* for `Settings.database.min_connections`: `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_MIN_CONNECTIONS`


:::info

If you use the Postgres database hosted by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), please click **Connect** on your project dashboard and find the following URL:

*    If you're on a IPv6 network, use the URL under **Direct connection**. You can visit [IPv6 test](https://test-ipv6.com/) to see if you have IPv6 Internet connection.
*    Otherwise, use the URL under **Session pooler**.

### GlobalExecutionOptions

`GlobalExecutionOptions` is used to configure the global execution options shared by all flows. It has the following fields:

*   `source_max_inflight_rows` (type: `int | None`, default: `1024`): The maximum number of concurrent inflight rows for all source operations.
*   `source_max_inflight_bytes` (type: `int | None`, default: `None`): The maximum number of concurrent inflight bytes for all source operations.

See also [flow definition docs](/docs/core/flow_def#control-processing-concurrency) about why it's necessary to control processing concurrency, and how to configure it on per-source basis.
If both global and per-source limits are specified, both need to be satisfied to admit additional source rows.

## List of Environment Variables

This is the list of environment variables, each of which has a corresponding field in `Settings`:

| environment variable | corresponding field in `Settings` | required? |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------|
| `COCOINDEX_APP_NAMESPACE` | `app_namespace` | No |
| `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_URL` | `database.url` | Yes |
| `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_USER` | `database.user` | No |
| `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_PASSWORD` | `database.password` | No |
| `COCOINDEX_DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `database.max_connections` | No (default: `25`) |
