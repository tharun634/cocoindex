# Neo4j

**Exports data to a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database.**


## Get Started
Read [Property Graph Targets](./index.md#property-graph-targets) for more information to get started on how it works in CocoIndex. 


## Spec

The `Neo4j` target spec takes the following fields:

*   `connection` ([auth reference](/docs/core/flow_def#auth-registry) to `Neo4jConnectionSpec`): The connection to the Neo4j database. `Neo4jConnectionSpec` has the following fields:
    *   `url` (`str`): The URI of the Neo4j database to use as the internal storage, e.g. `bolt://localhost:7687`.
    *   `user` (`str`): Username for the Neo4j database.
    *   `password` (`str`): Password for the Neo4j database.
    *   `db` (`str`, optional): The name of the Neo4j database to use as the internal storage, e.g. `neo4j`.
*   `mapping` (`Nodes | Relationships`): The mapping from collected row to nodes or relationships of the graph. For either [nodes to export](./index.md#nodes-to-export) or [relationships to export](./index.md#relationships-to-export).

Neo4j also provides a declaration spec `Neo4jDeclaration`, to configure indexing options for nodes only referenced by relationships. It has the following fields:

*   `connection` (auth reference to `Neo4jConnectionSpec`)
*   Fields for [nodes to declare](./index.md#declare-extra-node-labels), including
    *   `nodes_label` (required)
    *   `primary_key_fields` (required)
    *   `vector_indexes` (optional)

## Neo4j dev instance

If you don't have a Neo4j database, you can start a Neo4j database using our docker compose config:

```bash
docker compose -f <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/refs/heads/main/dev/neo4j.yaml) up -d
```

This will bring up a Neo4j instance, which can be accessed by username `neo4j` and password `cocoindex`.
You can access the Neo4j browser at [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474).
